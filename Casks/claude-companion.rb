  caveats <<~EOS
    Claude Companion is ad-hoc signed (not notarized). On first launch macOS Gatekeeper
    will block it. Approve it once with:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/ClaudeCompanion.app"

    or right-click the app in Finder and choose Open.

    The headline auto-approve gate installs a Claude Code hook from inside the app
    (a button in the popover), then reload your editor window to activate it.
