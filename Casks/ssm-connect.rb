  caveats <<~EOS
    SSM Connect is ad-hoc signed (not notarized). On first launch macOS Gatekeeper
    will block it. Approve it once with:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/SSMConnect.app"

    or right-click the app in Finder and choose Open.

    Amazon DCV Viewer is required for the default connect action:
      brew install --cask dcv-viewer
