  # Bumped automatically by .github/workflows/sync-postbode.yml, which reads
  # the latest vhco-pro/postbode release. Do not edit version/sha256 by hand.
  #
  # darwin-only on purpose: postbode shells out to osascript and launchctl,
  # reads the macOS Keychain via /usr/bin/security and installs as a launchd
  # LaunchAgent. There is no Linux build to point at.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      postbode needs two credentials before it can do anything:

        1. A ClearFacts personal access token with the scopes
           upload_document, read_administrations and statistics.
        2. A Google OAuth desktop client (User type: Internal if you are on
           Workspace — that avoids the 7-day refresh-token expiry), saved as
           credentials.json.

      The Gmail label it files submitted mail under must already exist and is
      matched by name; postbode will refuse to start the uploader rather than
      create a lookalike.

      Nothing is ever uploaded without you approving it in the review UI at
      http://127.0.0.1:7391 — run `postbode review` to open it.

      Start it with:  brew services start postbode
